				<p><strong>2016</strong></p>
<p>The Bushwick Arts Festival was established in 2016 to support local artists and art spaces who have been excited about 
participating in a large-scale, June-based art event.  
The festival was created as an entirely DIY initiative with no budget in place, and included 200 artists across 30 venues.  </p>
<p>Although specific attendance is hard to determine, the informational map of locations on the official website 
bushwickartsfestival.com received 2,400 unique visitors on the week of the event.  
Additionally, the event guide on the blog BushwickBomb.com received 400-700 unique visitors each day of the festival.  
All in all, the event was a success and a seriously fun time!  Feel free to check out 
the official festival Instagram page for some fun photos!</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong></p>

<p>The plans for the second edition of Bushwick Arts Festival will feature an exciting change of format, and will aim to 
provide real, tangible results for every participating artist, increase festival attendance and visibility, 
and offer opportunities for meaningful interactions for both artists and attendees.  
The majority of artists will be selected by a roster of well-qualified guest curators.  
No local artists will be charged any fees to participate, and any sales generated from the event will be commission-free!

<p>One noticable modification already is the change of date from the 1st weekend of June to the 3rd weekend of June.  
This should provide greater opportunity for New Yorkers and other interested parties to visit, since the event won't conflict 
with high profile events such as Governor's Ball and Figment.</p>

<p>This website will definitely be getting a complete overhaul, as well!
The specifics of the event will be revealed later in the year, and aims to be New York's premier, world-class art event.  
Bushwick Arts Festival 2017 promises to be a healthy breath of fresh air from generic art fairs.  
I know I can't wait!</p>
