		<uib-accordion-group heading="Why" >
		 Arts In Bushwick started a tradition of holding an annual open studios event in the neighborhood 9 years ago.  <br />
		They have just announced moving their event to October.  <br />
		Due to strong interest of artists in having a June-based opportunity to share their art with the public, BAF aims to provide a new 
		opportunity for a large scale open studios event.  Unlike previous open studios events in the neighborhood, BAF will not exclude artists 
		that do not reside or work in Bushwick.
